    "\n",
    "Point sources in CMB maps arise from a number of astrophysical objects including Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), Dust Star Forming Galaxies (DSFGs), and a bright tail of lensed DSFGs.  All of theses objects are interesting in their own right.  For the purposes of our mock skies we approximate these populations as a combination of a faint distribution of sources with a poisson distribution of brightness and small number of very bright sources with and exponentially falling source count.   This approximates the distribution of faint and bright sources seen in real CMB maps.   The source parameters were chosen by eye to look about the same as real maps at 150 GHz.   Detailed source counts have been published and can be consulted to add more reality into these simulations.  Publications also detail the frequency scalings of these sources.  In general DSFGs grow brighter at higher frequencies while AGNs have a spectrum that falls with increasing frequencies.  These behaviors must be included in multifrequency analyses and simulations."

    "## Section 1.4: SZ Map\n",
    "\n",
    "Clusters of galaxies imprint a subtle distortion into CMB maps that is most apparent on arcminute scales.    While clusters of galaxies are named after the galaxies bound within them, the galaxies represent only a small fraction of the matter contained within a cluster.   Roughly 80% of the baryons are not contained within galaxies, but rather exist as a cloud of gas bound within the gravitational potential well created by a dark matter halo that caries the vast majority of the mass of the cluster.  Within this well, the dilute gas becomes ionized and heated to temperatures of millions of Kelvin.  Occasionally a CMB photon interacts with one of the hot electrons in this ionized gas.  This interaction (inverse Compton scattering) gives the CMB photon a boost in energy.  Detailed calculations show that this effect (the Sunyev-Zeldovich or SZ effect) leads to decrement of power at frequencies below the 'null' at 220 GHz and extra power at higher frequencies.  This result is redshift independent.  Thus the SZ effect provides a clean way to detect clusters of galaxies and the signal which traces the electron density within the cluster.  The SZ signal is a reasonably good tracer of cluster mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these simulations we treat each cluster as having a brightness \"beta profile\", and fix each cluster to have an identical angular size.  We draw the distribution of central temperatures from the exponential distribution to simplify the code and reduce the dependance on external libraries.  For more accurate simulations, a range of clusters sizes should be used, a distribution of cluster shapes (with more accurate profiles) should be considered, and the number of clusters as a function of mass and redshift should be chosen to match measurements of the cluster mass function."
