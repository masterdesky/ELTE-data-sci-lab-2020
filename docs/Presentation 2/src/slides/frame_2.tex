\frametitle{Data releases}

\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> Data are available on the official page of the IRSA project\footnote{\url{https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/Planck/}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1-> Mostly full-sky maps, with some partially completed surveys
		\item<1-> Data are sorted by time, type, production pipeline, measuring instrument, etc.
		\item<1-> Filtered and unfiltered data are also available alongside the intensity and polarisation maps
	\end{itemize}
	\item<2-> Data are stored in HEALPix projected \texttt{.fits} format
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<2-> HEALPix is a pretty old standard for the pixelization of the sphere
		\item<2-> There are some important conventions of HEALPix which needs to be addressed to understand what is the angular power spectrum in case of the CMB and how can we measure it
	\end{itemize}
