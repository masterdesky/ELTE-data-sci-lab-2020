Describing the CMB is like describing energy levels of the hydrogen atom. So what do I mean? In the case of the hydrogen atom you have an initial/base image/model (the Schr√∂dinger equation in particular), which on itself could describe your observations pretty well to a certain extent. It is actually a good approximation regarding the position of the energy levels. But as your measurements become more and more precise, the more details come to light/unveil. You discover the fine structure, the hyperfine structure, so I mean all those small effects and components, which determines the actual/true structure of the energy levels in the H atom. You need to make numerous corrections to your base model to address all these perturbations.
The same goes for the CMB. You have some basic image (the angular power spectrum this time), which describes your observations pretty well. But there are a lot of other effects, which contribute to the final/actual structure of the CMB. Different type of point sources, Sunyev-Zeldovich sources, lensing effects, different effects of the measuring instrument. And you need to pay attention to all of these in a proper analysis of observational data or in an accurate computer simulation.

So my main goal is to
