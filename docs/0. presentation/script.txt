Hello everyone! Now it's my turn to speak about my Data Sci. Lab. project. So, in this course I'm focusing on the study of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiaton (or CMB for short). As I've seen all the names in this call, I can assume that of course everyone has heard of the CMB already.

* slide 1 *
You've probably also seen the image of the CMB, or more precisely the map of the temperature fluctuations in the CMB radiation. This phenomenon is obviously actively studied. It has an essential role in the understanding of fundamental questions and topics in physics. (It is used eg. to determine cosmological parameters or to better understand the events following the Big Bang).

* slide 2 *
In its core nature CMB is an immensely redshifted black-body radiation with average colour temperature of 2.725 K. By saying "CMB" we refer to the collection of those photons, which already existed during the recombination period of the universe. For a long period, the universe was opaque. Photons created in the Big Bang constantly scattered on electron in this very dense and hot "gas-universe". After ~three-hundred and seventy-thousand years after the Big Bang the universe cooled to a point (to ~3000 K), where the formation of hydrogen atoms was energetically favorable. We say, that at this point the existing photons "decoupled from the matter", their mean free path increased by an intangible extent, they stopped being in constant thermodynamical equilibrium with free electron and the universe become electromagnetically transparent. These photons travel through space since then, but due to the expansion of the universe they redshifted by a factor of 1100 from this original 3000 K to the already mentioned 2.725 K.

Just for clarity, let me tell you an analogue. Describing the CMB is similar to describing energy levels of the hydrogen atom. What do I mean? In the case of the hydrogen atom you have an initial/base image/model (the Schr√∂dinger equation in particular), which on itself could describe your observations pretty well to a certain extent. But as your measurements become more and more precise, the more details come to light/unveil. You discover the fine structure, the hyperfine structure, so I mean all those small effects and components, which determines the actual/true structure of the energy levels. Thus, you need to add numerous corrections to your base model to address all these perturbations.
Something similar goes for the CMB, but in the other way around. You have an initial observed image, but it is completely obstructed by various foreground and other effects. We have to manually peel off each superimposed layer, filter out these effects to reveal the fine structure: the true temperature variations in the CMB. Here's some partially unfiltered CMB map in all the nine frequency bands of the Planck space observatory. They still require a lengthy filtering process to clear them up.

For this class, my project goals could be divided into two big sections. The first one involes the simulation of artificial CMB maps and the determination of their power spectrum with, and without the additional effects from the instrument and other sources. The second section of the project consist of the analysis of actual observational data. Particularly data from the Planck telescope. I'm also going to reverse engineer the power spectrum from this real dataset and compare it against the simulated one. This requires first to filter out the mentioned superimposed effects in the raw data as much as possible. Optionally I'll also try to determine some of the cosmological constants using the Planck observations if that is possible within the confines of this course.

But in summary my main goal would be to get back the original power spectra as a result from both the analysis, and both from the simulation, which can be seen on this slide.

* slide 5 *
One a final note to the first section. Simulating a simple CMB map, which resembles to the original is not that hard. On the first slide I actually showed you a simulation I just made yesterday and maybe it looked conviencing enough to the untrained eye. Just for the reference, here's the original image of the Planck mission.

Thank you for your attention!
