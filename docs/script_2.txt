Hello everyone! Let me have a very brief summary of my project. In this course I'm studying the Cosmic Microwave Background radiaton. In my project I'm ought to analyse the simulation aspect of it, as well as I'm processing real observational data of the CMB. My two main goals are to replicate the CMB temperature map using an arbitrary angular power spectrum, and to extract the power spectrum from real observational data. This time, in this presentation I would like to speak about the latter topic, the power spectrum reconstruction.

* slide 1 *
The CMB radiation was first predicted in 1948, but it remained a fairly unpopular topic for astronomers until the mid '60s. That was the time, when more individual observations of the CMB came to light in a very short period of time. Until the early '70s a scientific consensus was slowly established to declare that the CMB is the remnant of the Big Bang. Around that time NASA issued a tender/announcement for spacecraft mission to study the CMB radiation from outside Earth's atmosphere. Since then, in these past 40 years, there were 3 notable spacecrafts of NASA (Russians also had at least one), which created complete sky maps of the CMB radiation. Each of them was much more and more deatiled, than their predecessor.

The last observations from space was done by the Planck space observatory. Our current most detailed data of the CMB comes from this telescope. Its mission lasted from 2009 to 2013, which was followed by 3 major data releases. The telescope was mounted with two distinct instruments to detect the CMB photons: One for the lower end of the freqency range and one for the higher freqeuncies. These two instruments mapped the whole sky on 9 different freqencies in the GHz domain between 100 and 900 Ghzs. Since these measurements are very noisey, and the CMB itself is completely obscured by foreground radiation, different filtering pipelines was utilized to separate the CMB from the foreground effects.

All of these data I mentioned are available to the public to freely access them. I linked the URL to the datasets in the footnote of this slide. These data are grouped by a number of differnet factors. By time, by the type of the map (eg. whether it's filtered or unfiltered or whether it's a polarisation map or intensity map, etc.). They're grouped based on the instrument they made them, grouped by frequencies, and so on.

All of these data are stored in regular .fits tables, in the so-called HEALPix projection if I can called it like this. HEALPix is an old and really widely used standard, not just in astronomy. It is a standard method for the effective pixelization of the sphere to help with lot of things realted to this problem. HEALPix utilizes some "conventions" as they call it.

* slide 3 *
If we have some bandlimited function (bandlimited in the context of signal processing) with the limit {l_max}, we can expand it in the following way, using spherical harmonics. Gamma is a unit vector normal to the surface of the sphere. Pixelising the function {f(gamma)} is equivalent to sampling the true {f(gamma)} in N points - in N pixels. The coefficients {a_lm} can be estimated now in the following way.

Now the angular power spectrum by definition can be expressed using these a_lm values.

* slide 4 *
Now, how can we use this in case of the CMB image? We can interpret the f(gamma) function mentioned above as a temperature fluctuation map on the surface of a sphere. Wink-wink that's the CMB, f(gamma) is the actual values of each pixel on the CMB temperature map. We can calculate then the a_lm coefficients by substituting this Delta T function with the f(gamma) function above, and then we can easily obtain the angular power spectrum using these coefficients and the definition of the {C_l} function.

Now, the HEALPix standard partially built on the Fortran90 standard, which actually had a subroutine called `anafast` to calculate these {a_lm} values and the {C_l} values as well. When HEALPix was later implemented in Python as a Python library, this function still remained. Using this, anyone can easily load any CMB HEALPix files, visualize it on any geographical projection, then calculate and plot its power spectrum.

So the real power spectrum is the C_l, but it is traditional to plot the D_l values, a function of the C_l power spectrum. And yes, it also looks much better. (Just for the record I'm not sure if this D_l quantity even has any name. I didn't found anything about this. Everyone call it just as D_l and nothing more.) 

* slide 5 - slide 6 *
Just as I said, using HEALPix really makes our life easier working with the CMB. You can visualize CMB maps in any projection you want. And using these, the CMB power spectrum can be created, and compared to the theoretical simulations. The difference on higher multipoles are due to instrumental noise, which wasn't yet substracted from the that exact dataset I used to plot it. I just wanted to show you now, that the pipeline works correctly, how the pipeline works, and that from an arbitrary input dataset, you can easily get the CMB maps and the power spectrum.

Thank you for your attention!
