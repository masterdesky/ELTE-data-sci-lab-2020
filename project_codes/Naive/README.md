# Naive generation of CMB maps based on the work of Jeff McMahon and Renée Hložek

## Disclaimer
In this directory there are my completely rewritten routines of the CMB summer school 2019 of the McMahon Cosmology Laboratory. The link to the original materials can be accessed [here](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/mcmahoncosmology/cmb-school) or directly from the [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/jeffmcm1977/CMBAnalysis_SummerSchool). The very core of my codes are built almost entirely on the logic and methods behined the mentioned work, but I expanded them in many parts and presented them in a completely new form.

## Code structure
There are three notebooks and and two `.py` module file in this directory. These two modules are called as `constants.py` and `cmb_modules.py`. The prior one stores the simulation constats and parameters. Also these values serves as the default arguments for functions in `cmb_modules.py`. The latter file contains every subroutine that was used in the notebooks and is complete on itself. All notebooks contain notes, comments and explanations almost entirely from the original authors Jeff McMahon and Renée Hložek.
